## Usage
Install packages with `npm i` after that check [.env_example](https://github.com/k-i-o/discord-virtual-fishing-farmer/blob/main/.env_example) and 
create your .env based on it following the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfm_dNu8EiY) (note: USER_ID is now [VIRTUALFISHER_USER_ID](https://github.com/k-i-o/discord-virtual-fishing-farmer/blob/main/.env_example))
after these passages run your bot with `node .` or `npm start`.

You can also run the bot on a vps or home server with docker just doing `docker compose up --build -d`. (note: also with docker you must create your .env)

To start the farming go in the designed guild in the specified channel and execute the command /fish

## IMPORTANT NOTE: DON'T SHARE YOUR .ENV WITH NOBODY THEY CAN STEAL YOUR DISCORD ACCOUNT WITH IT
